### iKettle legacy support

It has no event trigger system no rest api, only a command line interface but its good enough for Homebrigde ;-)

```

Usage: ibrewlegacy command host

Commands
    heat  Start heating water
    stop  Stop heating water
      65  65ºC selected
      80  80ºC selected
      95  95ºC selected
     100  100ºC selected
    warm  Keep water warm
       5  Keep water warm timer is set to 5 minutes
      10  Keep water warm timer is set to 10 minutes
      20  Keep water warm timer is set to 20 minutes
  status  Kettle status

    host  ip or host address of the iKettle

```

### Relay

Start a relay server on port 2081, it acts as an man in the middle passing messages between the appliance and
the clients like the Smarter app or another iBrew instances. It can be configured to block and/or modify/patch certain messages. And as there is only one connection needed to the appliances. Good riddense of the annoying beep when the wireless network disconnects due to overload of connections. Also statistics are now possible.


__Advantages__
 * No annoying beep. Only one connection to the appliance needed
 * A lot faster!
 * History and statistics possible!
 * Works with Smarter app!
 * Works with iBrew as client!?
 * Message blocking
 * Message patching

```ibrew dump relay 10.0.0.99```

#### Advance relay options

```ibrew dump relay in:DEBUG,out:DEBUG 10.0.0.99 127.0.0.1:3081```

Bind relay server to localhost on a different port and uses the firewall to block all debug messages

To change the firewall rules of a relay server already running, use

```ibrew remote unblock in:ADMIN,out:ADMIN 127.0.0.1:3081```

```ibrew remote block in:DEBUG,out:DEBUG 127.0.0.1:3081```

To see the rules use

```ibrew remote rules 127.0.0.1:3081```


### Firewall 

You can block messages either in (from the appliance) or out (from the relay), this can be usefull to disable calibration or other options like wifi and is internally used to speed things up :-)

```ibrew rules 10.0.0.99```

```ibrew unblock in:ADMIN,out:ADMIN 10.0.0.99```

```ibrew block in:DEBUG,out:DEBUG 10.0.0.99```


### Simulation

* Simulates iKettle 2.0 ```ibrew coffee simulate```
* Simulates Smarter Coffee machine ```ibrew kettle simulate```

You can use to dump action to see more info what is going on.

_Note that message blocking is disabled!_



You can add triggers by replacing the host (ip) with the word simulation and start it with the evens system enabled, if you want to try out triggers...

```
ibrew trigger add Domoticz Temperature http://127.0.0.1:8080/json.htm?type=command&param=udevice&idx=155&nvalue=0&svalue=§N simulation
ibrew events kettle simulate
```

### Web

This is a build in progress, please contribute!

Start the web interface 

```
ibrew web
```

and surf to:

```
http://ip:port/
```

#### Replacement for the Smarter app

Yeah I know the start and stop icons look terrible... and it is partly functional but you get no visual indicator it worked. Work in progress!

![devices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/devices.png)

#### Build in JSON Rest API

For bridging smarthome controllers or use it to integrate your appliance in your own website!

![rest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/api.png)

#### Setup

You can setup your appliance without the Smarter app. Default settings, calibration, descaling or wifi setup... it does it all! No internet required. This means you can use and setup the kettle and the smarter coffee even if smarters servers disappears (chance of no smarter servers in 5 years 97%, I seen it before :-/)

![settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/settings.png)

#### Statistics

It keeps stats for you, and you only! It does NOT send them (or anything else) to Smarter like the Smarter app does and definitly not to me...
Keep your appliance usage to yourself, will you!

![stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/stats.png)

#### Protocol description is fully interactive!

Cuz my code... :-) 

![protocol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/protocol.png)


### JSON REST API

You can find information on the iBrew JSON REST API in the Web Interface under:

```
http://ip:port/info/api
```

The default port is 2080

#### Example JSON return

http://localhost:2080/api/10.0.0.99/status

```
{"device": {"directmode": false, "connected": true, "host": "10.0.0.99", "firmware": {"version": 19, "certified": "iBrew certified firmware"}, "type": {"desciption": "iKettle 2.0", "id": 1}}, "default": {"formula": {"use": false, "temperature": {"fahrenheid": 32, "celsius": 0}}, "keepwarm": 0, "temperature": {"fahrenheid": 212, "celsius": 100, "prefered": "celsius"}}, "sensors": {"status": "ready", "base": "On", "temperature": {"raw": {"fahrenheid": 68, "celsius": 20}, "stable": {"fahrenheid": 68, "celsius": 20}}, "waterlevel": {"raw": 2005, "base": 920, "stable": 2004}}}
```

### JavaScript

Work in progress! Help would be nice!

JavaScript for use with iBrew JSON REST API [Javascript iBrew interface](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/blob/master/resources/ibrew.js) 
 
### Python

The [Python Smarter Interface](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/blob/master/smarter/) to the iKettle 2.0 and the Smarter Coffee is located in the Smarter folder. Use __pydoc__ or any other python doc app to see the help on [SmarterInterface.py](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/blob/master/smarter/SmarterInterface.py) and [SmarterProtocol.py](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/blob/master/smarter/SmarterProtocol.py). There are a lot of options and functions you can use!

#### Basic example

```
from smarter.SmarterInterface import *
from smarter.SmarterProtocol import *

appliance = SmarterClient()
appliance.host = "10.0.0.99"
appliance.connect()
if appliance.isKettle() and not appliance.heaterOn:
    appliance.kettle_heat_default()
appliance.disconnect()

```

### Smarthome controller push

You can pull values and states with the JSON REST api with it also possible to push values and state with the trigger events system.

To add

```
ibrew trigger add Domoticz Temperature http://127.0.0.1:8080/json.htm?type=command&param=udevice&idx=155&nvalue=0&svalue=§N 10.0.0.99

ibrew trigger add Scripts KettleBusy "C:\SCRIPTS\SENSOR.BAT §N" 10.0.0.99

ibrew trigger add Scripts KettleBusy "/home/pi/iBrew/scripts/sensor.sh §O §N" 10.0.0.99
```

where Domoticz is the group (one action per trigger per group) and §N is the new value and §O is the old value.

To see all triggers

`ibrew triggers`

To see all active triggers

`ibrew trigger`

monitor the trigger event system
 
`ibrew dump events 10.0.0.99`

or use the web server with auto re-connect :-)

`ibrew dump events web`

If you run the webserver as daemon/service add sudo to all your ibrew commands such that the right config file gets updated!

So instead of `ibrew trigger Domoticz state On 10.0.0.99` run `sudo ibrew trigger Domoticz state On 10.0.0.99`


It is possible to set boolean type to various formats (on/off, 1/0, enabled/disabled,...)


`ibrew trigger Domoticz state on`

See  `ibrew states` for an overview


And enable disable entire groups

`ibrew trigger Domoticz off`

See for group overview

`ibrew trigger groups`

Alpha!

## Guides

### [Domoticz](http://www.domoticz.com/)
[iBrew Forum Thread](http://domoticz.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&t=12985)

Lets set up a kettle temperature sensor and a on base sensor!

For this example the base url of domoticz is 

`http://127.0.0.1:8080/`

The IP of the kettle is `10.0.0.99`

Lets start!

Go to `Setup -> Hardware` and create a new dummy hardware called `Smarter`

![hardware](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/hardware.png)

Click on _Create Virtual Sensors_

![sensor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/sensor.png)

Create a temperature sensor

![temperature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/temperature.png)

Go to `Setup -> Devices` and look up your new sensor.

![devices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/devices.png)

Use the _idx_ of the sensor to add a trigger

```
ibrew trigger add Domoticz Temperature http://127.0.0.1:8080/json.htm?type=command&param=udevice&idx=155&nvalue=0&svalue=§N 10.0.0.99
```

Now we also add an on base motion sensor 

![switch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/switch.png)

Go to `Switches` and look up your new sensor.

![switches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/switches.png)

Edit it!

![motion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/motion.png)

Select motion 

![edit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/edit.png)

Look up the idx in `Setup -> Devices`

Use the _idx_ of the sensor to add a trigger

```
ibrew trigger add Domoticz OnBase http://127.0.0.1:8080/json.htm?type=command&param=switchlight&idx=99&switchcmd=%§N 10.0.0.99
```

We need to set up the right boolean state, domoticz uses the format _On_ or _Off_

`ibrew trigger Domoticz state On 10.0.0.99`

start any server with the events enables like

`ibrew dump events web`

If you run the webserver as daemon/service add sudo to all your ibrew commands such that the right config file gets updated!

So instead of `ibrew trigger Domoticz state On 10.0.0.99` run `sudo ibrew trigger Domoticz state On 10.0.0.99`

To see it in action!

For more information on [JSON used by domoticz!](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Domoticz_API/JSON_URL's)

Next step is creating and filling in buttons actions using either script:// or iBrew JSON Rest API!...

### HomeKit ~ [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)

Yes, you can! Connect your iKettle or Smarter Coffee to HomeKit... just follow the following steps!

#### Software

Install the following software to bridge iBrew with HomeKit

 * [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)
 * [cmdSwitch2](https://github.com/luisiam/homebridge-cmdswitch2)

#### Setup

Part of config file relevant to iKettle, iKettle 2.0 or Smarter Coffee

Fill in your own device host (either IP address or hostname) and location to iBrew, 

 * If you use an IP address: PLEASE use a static IP address! (assign in your router)
 * If you are the lucky owner of a router that assigns dynamic IP addresses with hostnames attached (usually in the form of device.local or device.lan) you can use that. If you are lucky, else use a static IP.
 * If you only have ONE device: you can use autodetection (and leave out the ip or hostname) but it adds a 2 seconds time penalty.
