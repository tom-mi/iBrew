# iBrew: Brewing on the 7th day

[iKettle 2.0](http://smarter.am/ikettle) and [Smarter Coffee](http://smarter.am/coffee) Interface


## Introduction
iBrew is a (python) interface to iKettle 2.0 and Smarter Coffee devices. It includes a console, monitor, command line interface, web interface and rest api. You can also use it in your own code. iKettle 2.0 v19 and SmarterCoffee v20 tested at the moment. Please share any other discoveries you made! 

This means your machine is free! You can connect it yourself and do whatever you want with it. Like interface it with your favorite smarthome controller!

#### Brewing on the 7th day 

Since the console it nearly done, protocol almost fully mapped out. It is time to focus on the webpage... the framework is working, it auto reconnect, keeps some stats and you can even preform some actions with it.


#### Contact
[Bugs or issues](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/issues). Donations & other questions <tristan@monkeycat.nl>
If you have jokes on coffee, tea, hot chocolade, coffee machines or kettles, please post in the issues.

Still no coffee machine (so no web for that)! I could like to thank Ju4ia for letting me access his coffee machine remotely, and get more Smarter Coffee missing protocol bits, and... that I could test the client code. And thanks for jkellerer for supplying coffee codes!
