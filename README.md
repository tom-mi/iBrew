# iBrew: The Dream Tea!

iKettle, [iKettle 2.0](http://smarter.am/ikettle) and [Smarter Coffee](http://smarter.am/coffee) Interface

## Needed remote access to iKettle 1, to test new code!

To test and finish: 
  * iKettle Emulation (emulates an iKettle with an iKettle 2.0)
  * iKettle Brigde (connect to an iKettle and use it if it was an iKettle 2)
  * Figure out to correct responses
  
Such that all features of iBrew are available (if supported)for the original iKettle!

So if you have an original iKettle filled up with water! And some time to spare!

## Hot! News

Now! macOS & windows apps! With nice icon in the taskbar! :-)

__Trigger! You can now push your data or run commands!__
It is now possible to push sensor values and states of the appliances to other smarthome controllers using HTTP or run commands!

__Please post links, information or help on interfacing with smarthome controllers software in the issues! There are too many out there for me to test and write guides for them all!__.
If you are a plugin coder or scripter and you do not have an iKettle or Smarter Coffee, __just simulate one!__

* Simulates iKettle 2.0 ```ibrew simulate```
* Simulates Smarter Coffee machine ```ibrew simulate```

### iBrew in the Media
[The iKettle, the Eleven-Hour Struggle to Make a Cup of Tea, and Why It Was All About Data, Analytics and Connecting Things Together](https://medium.com/mark-rittman/the-story-behind-the-ikettle-the-eleven-hour-struggle-to-make-a-cup-of-tea-and-why-it-was-all-769144d12d7#.h62foolse) 


### Old :-) News
I would like to thank Ju4ia for letting me access his coffee machine remotely, and get more Smarter Coffee missing protocol bits, and... that I could test the client code. And all the other people helping track down bugs and supplying new features, whether by e-mail or in the issues, Thanks!

Since the console it nearly done, protocol almost fully mapped out. It is time to focus on the webpage... the framework is working, it auto reconnect, keeps some stats and you can even preform some actions with it.

## Installing

Other systems than Windows, MacOS or Pi that are running python see download from source section.

### Windows 

  * [Windows]  (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12474226/iBrew.exe)

#### From source
First no python is installed by default so head up over to [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install v2.7 (NOT 3)
Secondly you need [make](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) and the python [win32 package](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/)

Use `make setupwin` to setup
Use `make win` to create a package 
Use `make cleanwin` to clean up

### MacOS
  * [MacOS]  (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12474226/iBrew.dmg)

Once you start the app from the MacOS package (drag it to your application folder first) it will auto link iBrew in your terminal.
Open a terminal and run ```ibrew``` and you're all set, good to go!

_it creates a soft symlink to /usr/local/bin/ibrew,... :-)_

#### From source
Make sure either the command line or xcode is installed, just run `make` and it will promt for a download!

Use `make setupmac` to setup
Use `make mac` to create a package 
Use `make cleanmac` to clean up

### Linux

See Pi section.

### Source

You can run iBrew on systems that run python 2.7. Download and unpack the [source](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/archive/master.zip), download it from github using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or manually `git clone https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew.git`. Finish the setup with running `make setup` in the iBrew folder to configure the python packages for bare bones operation. Update to the latest version of iBrew with `git pull`

### Raspberry Pi Jessy (light)

Tested on a clean Jessy light image (september 2016). 

Use `make setuplin` to setup
Use `make cleanlin` to clean up

#### Install 

SSH to the Pi! And use:

```
cd ~
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo easy_install pip
git clone https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew.git
cd ~/iBrew
sudo make setuplin
sudo ln -s ~/iBrew/ibrew /usr/local/bin/ibrew
```

Now you can start ibrew from anywhere :-) Type in your terminal

```
ibrew
```

Or if you want to start the web interface with event triggers type 

```
ibrew events web
```

And surf to your pi on port 2080!

#### Update 

You can update to the latest version of iBrew with

```
cd ~/iBrew
git pull
```

#### Start web server on pi boot

To add the webserver on boot run

```
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/iBrew.service
```

Copy and paste this text and save with ctrl-x

```
[Unit]
Description=iBrew

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable iBrew.service
sudo systemctl start iBrew.service
sudo systemctl status iBrew.service
```

#### Troubleshooting

Please post any bug or [issues](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/issues) here on github!
The error handling is still kinda broken... :-) now use dump to see more. Will revert to debug, info, logging (wip)

### Unable to connect to iKettle 2.0 or Smarter Coffee appliance

```
MoonTwo:iBrew Tristan$ ./ibrew list
[10.0.0.3:2016-11-13 12:38:24] Found iKettle 2.0 (iBrew certified firmware v19)
[10.0.0.98:2016-11-13 12:38:24] Found Smarter Coffee (iBrew certified firmware v20)
[10.0.0.99:2016-11-13 12:38:24] Found iKettle 2.0 (iBrew certified firmware v19)
```
Some hints
* Did you download, clone or pull iBrew from git to get the latest version with all the bug fixes?

Network trouble
 * Does the Smarter app autodetects it?
 * Is a firewall blocking port 2081 on your computer (or on your router)?
 * Does ```./ibrew list``` work?
 * Make sure that your kettle/coffee machine is on the same network and subnet as your pc and your phone.
 * It could be that your router is blocking utp broadcast messages (some do, so it never auto detects). 
 * Running it on a computer with only a loopback device will result in auto detection be disabled (when using the simulator)

Static IP address
 * Look up the IP address of the appliance in your router (dhpc server)
 * Set up a static IP address in your router (dhpc server) for your appliance

Reset wireless network
 * Reset appliance (iKettle is longer then 10 seconds button hold on base, coffee machine, eeuh I forgot which button but you can use the smarter app to reset your appliance wireless network to direct mode [FIX])
 * If the appliance is reset. Try connect with your wifi of your pc (if it has wifi) to the appliance its wireless network access point iKettle:?? or SmarterCoffee:?? try if iBrew works.
 * Reconnect to your wifi network (and if you are lucky and could connect with iBrew in direct mode, the command is ./ibrew join namewireless password) else use your phone app.

    settings 100 20 True 75  Set default user settings for the kettle to...


```

### Relay

Start a relay server on port 2081, it acts as an man in the middle passing messages between the appliance and
the clients like the Smarter app or another iBrew instances. It can be configured to block and/or modify/patch certain messages. And as there is only one connection needed to the appliances. Good riddense of the annoying beep when the wireless network disconnects due to overload of connections. Also statistics are now possible.


__Advantages__
 * No annoying beep. Only one connection to the appliance needed
 * A lot faster!
 * History and statistics possible!
 * Works with Smarter app!
 * Works with iBrew as client!?
 * Message blocking
 * Message patching

```ibrew relay 10.0.0.99```

#### Advance relay options

```ibrew dump relay in:DEBUG,out:DEBUG 10.0.0.99 127.0.0.1:3081```

Bind relay server to localhost on a different port and uses the firewall to block all debug messages

To change the firewall rules of a relay server already running, use

```ibrew remote unblock in:ADMIN,out:ADMIN 127.0.0.1:3081```

```ibrew remote block in:DEBUG,out:DEBUG 127.0.0.1:3081```

To see the rules use

```ibrew remote rules 127.0.0.1:3081```


### Firewall 

You can block messages either in (from the appliance) or out (from the relay), this can be usefull to disable calibration or other options like wifi and is internally used to speed things up :-)

```ibrew rules 10.0.0.99```

```ibrew unblock in:ADMIN,out:ADMIN 10.0.0.99```

```ibrew block in:DEBUG,out:DEBUG 10.0.0.99```


### Simulation

* Simulates iKettle 2.0 ```ibrew coffee simulate```
* Simulates Smarter Coffee machine ```ibrew kettle simulate```

You can use to dump action to see more info what is going on.

_Note that message blocking is disabled!_



You can add triggers by replacing the host (ip) with the word simulation and start it with the evens system enabled, if you want to try out triggers...

```
ibrew trigger add Domoticz Temperature "http://127.0.0.1:8080/json.htm?type=command&param=udevice&idx=155&nvalue=0&svalue=§N" simulation
ibrew events kettle simulate
```

### Web

This is a build in progress, please contribute!

Start the web interface 

```
ibrew web
```

and surf to:

```
http://ip:port/

#### Replacement for the Smarter app

Yeah I know the start and stop icons look terrible... and it is partly functional but you get no visual indicator it worked. Work in progress!

![devices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/devices.png)

#### Build in JSON Rest API

For bridging smarthome controllers or use it to integrate your appliance in your own website!

![rest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/api.png)

#### Setup

You can setup your appliance without the Smarter app. Default settings, calibration, descaling or wifi setup... it does it all! No internet required. This means you can use and setup the kettle and the smarter coffee even if smarters servers disappears (chance of no smarter servers in 5 years 97%, I seen it before :-/)

![settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/settings.png)

#### Statistics

It keeps stats for you, and you only! It does NOT send them (or anything else) to Smarter like the Smarter app does and definitly not to me...
Keep your appliance usage to yourself, will you!

![stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/stats.png)

#### Protocol description is fully interactive!

Cuz my code... :-) 

![protocol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/protocol.png)


### JSON REST API

You can find information on the iBrew JSON REST API in the Web Interface under:

```
http://ip:port/info/api
```

The default port is 2080

#### Example JSON return

http://localhost:2080/api/10.0.0.99/status

```
{"device": {"directmode": false, "connected": true, "host": "10.0.0.99", "firmware": {"version": 19, "certified": "iBrew certified firmware"}, "type": {"desciption": "iKettle 2.0", "id": 1}}, "default": {"formula": {"use": false, "temperature": {"fahrenheid": 32, "celsius": 0}}, "keepwarm": 0, "temperature": {"fahrenheid": 212, "celsius": 100, "prefered": "celsius"}}, "sensors": {"status": "ready", "base": "On", "temperature": {"raw": {"fahrenheid": 68, "celsius": 20}, "stable": {"fahrenheid": 68, "celsius": 20}}, "waterlevel": {"raw": 2005, "base": 920, "stable": 2004}}}
```

### JavaScript

Work in progress! Help would be nice!

JavaScript for use with iBrew JSON REST API [Javascript iBrew interface](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/blob/master/resources/ibrew.js) 
 
### Python

Python 2.7 only!

The [Python Smarter Interface](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/blob/master/smarter/) to the iKettle 2.0 and the Smarter Coffee is located in the Smarter folder. Use __pydoc__ or any other python doc app to see the help on [SmarterInterface.py](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/blob/master/smarter/SmarterInterface.py) and [SmarterProtocol.py](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/blob/master/smarter/SmarterProtocol.py). There are a lot of options and functions you can use!

#### Basic example

```
from smarter.SmarterInterface import *
from smarter.SmarterProtocol import *

appliance = SmarterClient()
appliance.setHost("10.0.0.99")
appliance.connect()
if appliance.isKettle() and not appliance.heaterOn:
    appliance.kettle_heat_default()
appliance.disconnect()

```

### Smarthome controller push

You can pull values and states with the JSON REST api with it also possible to push values and state with the trigger events system.

To add

```
ibrew trigger add Domoticz Temperature "http://127.0.0.1:8080/json.htm?type=command&param=udevice&idx=155&nvalue=0&svalue=§N" 10.0.0.99

ibrew trigger add Scripts KettleBusy "C:\SCRIPTS\SENSOR.BAT §N" 10.0.0.99

ibrew trigger add Scripts KettleBusy "/home/pi/iBrew/scripts/sensor.sh §O §N" 10.0.0.99
```

where Domoticz is the group (one action per trigger per group) and §N is the new value and §O is the old value.

To see all triggers

`ibrew triggers`

To see all active triggers

`ibrew trigger`

monitor the trigger event system
 
`ibrew dump events 10.0.0.99`

or use the web server with auto re-connect :-)

`ibrew dump events web`

If you run the webserver as daemon/service add sudo to all your ibrew commands such that the right config file gets updated!

So instead of `ibrew trigger Domoticz state On 10.0.0.99` run `sudo ibrew trigger Domoticz state On 10.0.0.99`


It is possible to set boolean type to various formats (on/off, 1/0, enabled/disabled,...)


`ibrew trigger Domoticz state on`

See  `ibrew states` for an overview


And enable disable entire groups

`ibrew trigger Domoticz off`

See for group overview

`ibrew trigger groups`

Alpha!

## Guides

### [Domoticz](http://www.domoticz.com/)
[iBrew Forum Thread](http://domoticz.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&t=12985)

Lets set up a kettle temperature sensor and a on base sensor!

For this example the base url of domoticz is 

`http://127.0.0.1:8080/`

The IP of the kettle is `10.0.0.99`

Lets start!

Go to `Setup -> Hardware` and create a new dummy hardware called `Smarter`

![hardware](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/hardware.png)

Click on _Create Virtual Sensors_

![sensor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/sensor.png)

Create a temperature sensor

![temperature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/temperature.png)

Go to `Setup -> Devices` and look up your new sensor.

![devices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/devices.png)

Use the _idx_ of the sensor to add a trigger

```
ibrew trigger add Domoticz Temperature "http://127.0.0.1:8080/json.htm?type=command&param=udevice&idx=155&nvalue=0&svalue=§N" 10.0.0.99
```

Now we also add an on base motion sensor 

![switch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/switch.png)

Go to `Switches` and look up your new sensor.

![switches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/switches.png)

Edit it!

![motion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/motion.png)

Select motion 

![edit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tristan79/iBrew/master/distro/images/domoticz/edit.png)

Look up the idx in `Setup -> Devices`

Use the _idx_ of the sensor to add a trigger

```
ibrew trigger add Domoticz OnBase "http://127.0.0.1:8080/json.htm?type=command&param=switchlight&idx=99&switchcmd=§N" 10.0.0.99
```

We need to set up the right boolean state, domoticz uses the format _On_ or _Off_

`ibrew trigger Domoticz state On 10.0.0.99`

start any server with the events enables like

`ibrew dump events web`

If you run the webserver as daemon/service add sudo to all your ibrew commands such that the right config file gets updated!

So instead of `ibrew trigger Domoticz state On 10.0.0.99` run `sudo ibrew trigger Domoticz state On 10.0.0.99`

To see it in action!

For more information on [JSON used by domoticz!](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Domoticz_API/JSON_URL's)

Next step is creating and filling in buttons actions using either script:// or iBrew JSON Rest API!...

### HomeKit ~ [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)

Yes, you can! Connect your iKettle or Smarter Coffee to HomeKit... just follow the following steps!

#### Software

Install the following software to bridge iBrew with HomeKit

 * [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)
 * [cmdSwitch2](https://github.com/luisiam/homebridge-cmdswitch2)

#### Setup

Part of config file relevant to iKettle, iKettle 2.0 or Smarter Coffee

Fill in your own device host (either IP address or hostname) and location to iBrew, 

 * If you use an IP address: PLEASE use a static IP address! (assign in your router)
 * If you are the lucky owner of a router that assigns dynamic IP addresses with hostnames attached (usually in the form of device.local or device.lan) you can use that. If you are lucky, else use a static IP.
 * If you only have ONE device: you can use autodetection (and leave out the ip or hostname) but it adds a 2 seconds time penalty.
