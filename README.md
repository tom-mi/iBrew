# iBrew Kettle Rattle

[iKettle 2.0](http://smarter.am/ikettle) and [Smarter Coffee](http://smarter.am/coffee) Interface


## Introduction
iBrew is a (python) interface to iKettle 2.0 and Smarter Coffee devices. It includes a console, monitor, command line interface, web interface and rest api. You can also use it in your own code. iKettle 2.0 v19 and SmarterCoffee v20 tested at the moment. Please share any other discoveries you made!

This means your machine is free! You can connect it yourself and do whatever you want with it. Like interface it with your favorite smarthome controller!

#### Contact
[Bugs or issues](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/issues). Donations & other questions <tristan@monkeycat.nl>
If you have jokes on coffee, tea, hot chocolade, coffee machines or kettles, please post in the issues.

Still no coffee machine (so no web for that)! I could like to thank Ju4ia for letting me access his coffee machine remotely, so I could test the client code and helping me
get more SmarterCoffee missing protocol stuff.

## Usage

### Command Line

See the console section for the commands
 
```

  iBrew Web Server

  Usage: iBrew (dump) (fahrenheid) web (port) (host)

    web                    start web interface & rest api
    port                   optional port number, default 2082


  iBrew Command Line

  Usage: iBrew (dump) (shout|slow) (coffee|kettle) (fahrenheid) [command] (host)

    dump                   dump message enabled
    shout                  sends commands and quits not waiting for a reply
    slow                   fully inits everything before action
    coffee                 assumes coffee machine
    kettle                 assumes kettle
    command                action to take!
    fahrenheid             use fahrenheid
    host                   host address (format: ip4, ip6, fqdn)

  If you do not supply a host, it will try to connect to the first detected device
  Thus if you have more then one device supply a host (if its not in direct mode)


```
